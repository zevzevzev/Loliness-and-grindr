Personal reflections on Grindr and loneliness

| I don&#39;t feel so alone k
wing that there are other gay people so close by, | Even if some of them are weird or rude. Cause a certain amount of any population is bound to be. | The primary function of Grindr is to meet and get to know new people. What you do with said people is up to you |
| --- | --- | --- |
| I still prefer Instagram, but no-one goes on it to talk, not even myself. | Nowhere do I feel more alone than at uni. Where there are a gazillion people I _could_ bond with but I can&#39;t | I like the Grindr grid layout because it&#39;s like the pick-and-mix at a cinema. |
| I find that Instagram isn&#39;t particularly good at fostering communities or long-lasting connections. It&#39;s like trying to grow vegetables in tarmac | If I wanted to create a tight-knit group of friends online I would use Reddit or Discord. | I feel like this is because Instagram is too generalised, literally everyone is on Instagram and there&#39;s no way of differentiating them |
| Sometimes people disappear from Grindr. Where do they go??? | I like how on Grindr, you can ostensibly tell a lot about a person. | But you can&#39;t do this in real life. |
